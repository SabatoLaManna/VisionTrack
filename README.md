# VisionTrack  

"VisionTrack" is an innovative real-time application that uses computer vision to detect and interpret hand gestures and facial expressions through a webcam. By leveraging the powerful Mediapipe library, the project recognizes a variety of hand gestures (such as fist, open hand, pinching, middle finger, and thumbs up/down) and facial expressions (like smiling, frowning, open mouth, closed eyes, and neutral expression). This project aims to offer interactive gesture control and expression analysis, making it ideal for applications such as virtual interfaces, human-computer interaction, or even just for fun, visualizing the power of AI-driven gesture and emotion recognition.

Features include:

Hand gesture detection and labeling
Facial expression detection (smile, frown, neutral, etc.)
Real-time feedback with dynamic labeling
Customizable options for displaying hand landmarks, wires, and facial features
Built with **Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe**, this project demonstrates the integration of facial and hand tracking, allowing users to engage with a system through simple gestures and expressions.
